    "report": "\nCurrent Situation:\nCalifornia is currently facing a severe wildfire crisis, with major incidents occurring in San Diego, Santa Barbara, and air quality issues extending to San Jose. The wildfires are rapidly spreading, threatening residential areas and forcing evacuations. Approximately 10,700 people are directly affected across San Diego and Santa Barbara. Strong winds are making firefighting efforts challenging. In addition, the fires are causing deteriorating air quality, with San Jose reporting around 50 people experiencing respiratory problems so far.\n\nResource Needs:\nBased on historical wildfire data for the affected counties in California, the following resources are projected to be needed to address this disaster:\n\n1. Firefighting Personnel: \n- 500-800 firefighters for San Diego County\n- 300-500 firefighters for Santa Barbara County\nEstimated cost: $5-8 million \n\n2. Firefighting Equipment:\n- 50 fire engines\n- 10 air tankers \n- 5 helicopters\nEstimated cost: $10-15 million\n\n3. Emergency Shelters & Supplies:\n- Shelter for 8,000-10,000 evacuees \n- Food, water, bedding, hygiene kits\nEstimated cost: $3-5 million\n\n4. Medical Resources:\n- Deployment of emergency medical teams\n- Medicines and treatments for smoke inhalation and respiratory issues \n- Mobile clinics or temporary medical facilities\nEstimated cost: $1-2 million\n\n5. Air Quality Monitoring & Equipment:\n- Expanded air quality monitoring across affected counties\n- Distribution of N95 masks to residents\nEstimated cost: $500,000-1 million\n\nTotal Estimated Cost: $19.5-31 million\n\nThe costs are early projections based on past wildfire disasters in California. Actual costs will depend on the ultimate severity and duration of these incidents. Immediate mobilization of the above firefighting, shelter, medical and air quality resources are critical to saving lives, containing the wildfires and mitigating further health impacts. Continuous monitoring of the situation and close coordination between state, local and federal agencies will be required throughout the response to this devastating disaster.\n"
