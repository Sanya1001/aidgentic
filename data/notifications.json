    "report": "Based on the regional wildfire situation report for Southern California, the following resources are projected to be needed to address the humanitarian impacts:\n\nFirefighting Resources:\n- At least 1,500 additional firefighters to supplement local crews across the two major fires\n- 50 additional fire engines and 10 water tenders to combat the flames\n- 15 aircraft, including helicopters and air tankers, for aerial firefighting support\n- Protective gear and breathing apparatus for firefighters \n\nEvacuation and Shelter:\n- Evacuation assistance for up to 10,000 residents, focusing on the 7,500 most at-risk near San Diego\n- Emergency temporary shelters to house evacuees, with capacity for 8,000-10,000 people\n- Shelter supplies including cots, blankets, hygiene kits, and ready-to-eat meals to support evacuees\n- Transportation vehicles and fuel to facilitate evacuation efforts\n\nMedical and Public Health:\n- Medical personnel and supplies to treat smoke inhalation, burns, and other fire-related injuries \n- Mental health support services for evacuees and those impacted by the wildfires\n- N95 masks or equivalent for residents affected by poor air quality, especially near Santa Barbara\n\nAgricultural Protection:\n- Deployment of resources to construct firebreaks around key agricultural assets like vineyards\n- Assistance for farmers in moving livestock or valuable equipment out of harm's way\n\nLogistics and Communications:\n- Establishment of staging areas and supply chain for efficient distribution of relief resources\n- Satellite phones and radio equipment to maintain communications in affected areas\n- Incident command posts to coordinate response efforts across multiple jurisdictions\n\nCost Estimate:\nBased on historical data from previous California wildfires, a disaster of this scale affecting over 10,000 people could incur costs exceeding $50 million for immediate response efforts. This includes firefighting operations, evacuation and sheltering, and emergency logistics. Longer-term recovery costs will likely be much higher.\n\nThis is an initial assessment based on currently available information. Close monitoring of the situation will be necessary to adapt resource deployment as conditions change. Expediting the mobilization of these critical resources can help save lives, protect property, and support affected communities in Southern California during this wildfire crisis."

    "report": "Humanitarian Response Resource Requirements Report\\nCalifornia Earthquake - April 21, 2025\\n\\nOverview:\\nA severe earthquake has caused widespread damage in the California cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Sacramento. Buildings have collapsed, roads are destroyed, fires have broken out, and thousands of people are affected, injured, or trapped. Immediate resources are needed for search and rescue, medical aid, firefighting, temporary shelter, and infrastructure repairs.\\n\\nAffected Areas and Population:\\n- San Jose: ~5,935 people affected \\n- Sacramento: ~5,000 people affected\\n- San Francisco: Specific count not provided, but also heavily impacted\\n\\nResource Requirements:\\nBased on historical data from a 2024 California earthquake and extrapolating to the scale of the 2025 disaster:\\n\\n1. Search and Rescue \\n- Estimated 400-500 rescue workers needed across affected cities\\n- Additional specialized equipment likely required for building collapses\\n\\n2. Medical Aid\\n- Estimated 500-750 medical staff needed, including doctors, nurses, EMTs\\n- Medical supplies for thousands of potential injuries\\n- Emergency pop-up clinics or hospital expansions \\n\\n3. Firefighting\\n- Estimated 200-300 firefighters \\n- Fire trucks and water/chemical supplies\\n- Widespread effort needed in San Jose and Sacramento neighborhood fires\\n\\n4. Food and Water\\n- Estimated $100,000 - $150,000 for emergency food provisions\\n- Estimated $50,000 - $75,000 for water \\n- Amounts scaled up for larger affected population vs. 2024\\n\\n5. Temporary Shelter\\n- Estimated $2,000,000 - $3,000,000 based on providing shelter for 10,000+ displaced residents\\n- Tents, cots, blankets and other shelter supplies\\n- Location/land for shelter set-up\\n\\n6. Infrastructure Repairs\\n- Engineers and construction crews to assess and repair roads, bridges, buildings\\n- Heavy equipment for debris removal and restoration\\n- Estimated costs likely in the millions based on descriptions of severe damage\\n\\nNote: Figures are rough estimates based on limited 2024 data. A more detailed assessment of the 2025 situation is urgently needed to validate and refine the specific quantities of resources required. Actual costs may be significantly higher given the scale of damage across multiple major cities.\\n\\nImmediate Next Steps:\\n1. Activate and deploy search and rescue teams to San Jose and Sacramento as top priorities given reports of trapped residents. Simultaneously mobilize firefighters to combat active fires. \\n\\n2. Set up emergency medical facilities and begin treating injured residents. Call in additional medical staff and supplies from surrounding areas.\\n\\n3. Identify and clear spaces for temporary shelter locations. Begin set-up and equipping of shelters.\\n\\n4. Conduct on-the-ground assessments of affected neighborhoods to determine precise resource gaps. Adjust supply orders and personnel assignments as needed.\\n\\n5. Coordinate with state and federal agencies for additional emergency funds, personnel, and supplies. International aid organizations may also need to be engaged given scale of disaster.\\n\\nIn conclusion, extensive resources and multi-agency coordination will be essential to mount an effective humanitarian response across San Francisco, San Jose and Sacramento. Immediate action is paramount to save lives and provide relief to affected residents. This initial assessment can guide resource mobilization while ongoing evaluations refine the response."
