    "report": "Humanitarian Response Briefing: California Wildfires \n\nSituation Overview:\nTwo major wildfires are currently burning in the state of California, placing over 10,000 residents at risk. The most severe fire is located near San Diego, affecting an estimated 7,500 people and prompting ongoing evacuations as homes are threatened. A second fire of moderate severity has ignited in the Santa Barbara area, impacting approximately 3,200 residents and straining local firefighting resources that are concurrently battling the San Diego blaze.\n\nResource Requirements:\nWhile we searched our historical disaster knowledge base, there was no data found on past wildfire costs and resource needs in California to draw upon for estimates. However, based on the scale and severity outlined in the situation report, we anticipate the following resources will be required:\n\n1. Emergency Shelters and Supplies: Sufficient emergency shelter capacity and essential supplies like food, water, bedding and hygiene kits will be needed to house and care for up to 10,700 evacuees from the fire zones. Shelters should be established in safe areas in partnership with local emergency management.\n\n2. Firefighting Personnel and Equipment: A surge of firefighting personnel and equipment, including fire engines, air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers will be needed to bolster containment efforts on both the San Diego and Santa Barbara fires. This should include mobilizing mutual aid from other areas of the state and potentially requesting federal firefighting support. \n\n3. Disaster Relief Funds: Emergency funds to cover temporary housing costs, cleanup and rebuilding of damaged homes, crisis counseling, and other essential assistance for affected residents. The total funding required is difficult to estimate without property damage assessments, but is likely to be substantial given the number of people impacted.\n\n4. Public Health and Medical Support: Smoke from the wildfires may cause air quality issues and exacerbate health problems. Medical personnel and supplies should be readied to treat smoke inhalation and support vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn summary, a major humanitarian response effort will be required to address the immediate safety and support needs of over 10,000 Californians impacted by these wildfires. Mobilizing emergency shelters, firefighting resources, relief funding and public health support in close coordination with state and local agencies is critical. Continuous monitoring of the fire situations will also be needed to adapt the response as conditions evolve. While we lack historical data to precisely quantify costs, the resources outlined above provide a baseline for initial planning and should be refined as more impact data becomes available."

    "report": "Humanitarian Situation Briefing: California Wildfires and Air Quality \nDate: May 23, 2024\n\nCurrent Situation:\nThe state of California is facing multiple crises that require immediate attention and resources. Two major wildfires are actively threatening lives and property:\n\n1. In San Diego, a rapidly spreading wildfire is endangering residential areas, affecting approximately 7,500 people. Strong winds are complicating firefighting efforts, and evacuations are underway. \n\n2. Near Santa Barbara, a wildfire in the hills is threatening local vineyards and rural homes, with an estimated 3,200 people affected. Firefighting resources are strained as they work to control the blaze.\n\nIn addition to the wildfires, residents in San Jose are experiencing respiratory issues due to deteriorating air quality, with around 50 people directly affected so far. The cause is currently unknown and requires further investigation.\n\nResource Needs:\nProjection of resource requirements for the wildfires would require referencing California's historical data for comparable past wildfire events in the state. Unfortunately, a search of available historical disaster data did not return any pertinent information to use in generating cost and resource estimates for the current wildfire situations.\n\nThe concerning air quality decline in San Jose also needs additional monitoring and investigation before being able to assess the potential resource needs there. \n\nImmediate priorities should focus on:\n- Evacuation assistance for populations in the direct path of the wildfires \n- Arranging temporary shelter and basic necessities for evacuees\n- Deploying reinforcements and crucial equipment to support firefighting operations\n- Providing medical attention to those suffering from the poor air quality in San Jose\n\nTo summarize, California is facing an urgent humanitarian situation with the wildfires near San Diego and Santa Barbara, and the air quality issues in San Jose. While specific resource projections are limited by a lack of accessible historical data, it is clear that significant aid is needed to protect lives, contain the fires, and investigate the source of the air quality problems. Continuous monitoring of the situation and collaboration between the state, local agencies, federal support and humanitarian organizations will be essential for an effective response. Further assessments to quantify resource needs should be an ongoing priority as more data becomes available."
