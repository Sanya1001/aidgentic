    "report": "Humanitarian Response Briefing: California Wildfires \n\nSituation Overview:\nTwo major wildfires are currently burning in the state of California, placing over 10,000 residents at risk. The most severe fire is located near San Diego, affecting an estimated 7,500 people and prompting ongoing evacuations as homes are threatened. A second fire of moderate severity has ignited in the Santa Barbara area, impacting approximately 3,200 residents and straining local firefighting resources that are concurrently battling the San Diego blaze.\n\nResource Requirements:\nWhile we searched our historical disaster knowledge base, there was no data found on past wildfire costs and resource needs in California to draw upon for estimates. However, based on the scale and severity outlined in the situation report, we anticipate the following resources will be required:\n\n1. Emergency Shelters and Supplies: Sufficient emergency shelter capacity and essential supplies like food, water, bedding and hygiene kits will be needed to house and care for up to 10,700 evacuees from the fire zones. Shelters should be established in safe areas in partnership with local emergency management.\n\n2. Firefighting Personnel and Equipment: A surge of firefighting personnel and equipment, including fire engines, air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers will be needed to bolster containment efforts on both the San Diego and Santa Barbara fires. This should include mobilizing mutual aid from other areas of the state and potentially requesting federal firefighting support. \n\n3. Disaster Relief Funds: Emergency funds to cover temporary housing costs, cleanup and rebuilding of damaged homes, crisis counseling, and other essential assistance for affected residents. The total funding required is difficult to estimate without property damage assessments, but is likely to be substantial given the number of people impacted.\n\n4. Public Health and Medical Support: Smoke from the wildfires may cause air quality issues and exacerbate health problems. Medical personnel and supplies should be readied to treat smoke inhalation and support vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn summary, a major humanitarian response effort will be required to address the immediate safety and support needs of over 10,000 Californians impacted by these wildfires. Mobilizing emergency shelters, firefighting resources, relief funding and public health support in close coordination with state and local agencies is critical. Continuous monitoring of the fire situations will also be needed to adapt the response as conditions evolve. While we lack historical data to precisely quantify costs, the resources outlined above provide a baseline for initial planning and should be refined as more impact data becomes available."
